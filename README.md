## Why it was made

Back on 2018-10-27 I participated in the SpeedBots 2 Challenge, where people use RLBot to make custom Rocket League bots in only 3 hours, then throw them in a tournament. This is how VolleyBot was born!

This was built on top of https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotJavaExample

## Usage Instructions:

1. Make sure you've installed Python 3.6.5 or newer. Here's [Python 3.7 64 bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-amd64.exe). Some older versions like 3.6.0 will not work. During installation:
   - Select "Add Python to PATH"
   - Make sure pip is included in the installation
1. Make sure you've installed Java 8 or newer. 
  - If you just want to ***run*** the bot, get the [Java 8 JRE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html).
  - If you also want to modify the bot, get the [Java 8 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
1. Make sure you've [set the JAVA_HOME environment variable](https://javatutorial.net/set-java-home-windows-10).
1. Download this repository
1. Open Rocket League
1. Double click on run-bot.bat and leave it running. It's supposed to stay
open and it's OK if it says something like "75%".
1. Double click on run-framework-gui.bat
1. Click the 'Run' button
